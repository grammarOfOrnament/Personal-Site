# Project Background
<!-- - Developed an event logs page for the enterprise application, Waypoint, aiming to enhance findability and readability to aid users in evaluating application performance.
- Addressed issues with event logs to uncover unnoticed bugs and improve user experience. -->
**Goals**: Attain deep insights into Waypoint's functionality and areas needing improvement, enabling swift and strategic platform-wide adjustments. This initiative will significantly enhance our business-to-customer relationship, bolstering client trust and confidence in our services.
<br>**Project significance**: Resolving historical lack of evidence for reported issues, fostering a more proactive approach to resolving client concerns.
<br>**Target Audience**: SaaS business and software development managers.
<br>**Clientâ€™s Industry**: Government-focused, Large Scale Scrum software as a service business.
<br>**Time**: 1 two-week sprint

# Research Phase
- Conducted Usability Testing
    - Discovered challenges: Incomplete data, disorganized logs, data readability, navigation difficulties (findability).
    - Task completion involved log finding, accessing logs belonging to groups, date range filtering, sharing logs, and comprehension of log messages. 
- Dot Voting
    - Confirmed user preference for the location of a section related to the event log feature. 
    - Users prefered the features in seperate pages, but as neighbors in the sitemap with links allowing one to jump from one area to another as both features required plenty of real estate and users mentioned how they'd likely want to bookmark both in their browsers.

# Design Process
- The process involved user flow analysis, usability testing, wireframing, dot voting, high fidelity designs, additional usability testing.
- Continuous iterations based on user feedback and usability testing results.
- User feedback led to the inclusion of progressive disclosure in filters, access to multiple filters at once, and a collapsible sidebar for filter management to achieve all of that cleanly.

# Prototyping and Testing
- Low-fidelity wireframes and high-fidelity designs were created as the project progressed.
- Usability testing teased out any remaining, glaring issues in our implemented solution.
- Comprehensive accessibility testing included testing tab stop functionality, automated checks, and analysis of HTML heading structure using Accessibility Insights for the Web and ANDI.
